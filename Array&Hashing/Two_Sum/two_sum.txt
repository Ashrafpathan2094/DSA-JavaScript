So instead of writing a nested loop to check the sum we just add a map and in that map we start adding
the complement values so we dont have to get the value by looping again, we keep checking the complement 
values on every loop and if it has that value we just return it.
NOTE: we are saving the value as key and its position as its value inside the map
